# Project title :
Prediction of iris.csv dataset for DecisionTree Algorithm using supervised learning machine algorithm.

# Problem Statement :
A American waist botnical garden grow iris flower in their labs but using bio technology in a single tree different types of variety flower is grow. As a Data Science Engineer find out how much accuracy is their all categories contains same species.

# Accuracy :

# Conclusion :
According to my Decision tree model the flower not contains exact same species, but only 1% species is found.
